# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

## What does the project do?
The project will open a "lottery pool" for two users to join. To join a "lottery pool", users will have to stake a certain (pre-defined) amount of ETH. Once two users have joined the pool, the app will "flip a coin" and transfer the staked ETH to the winning address.

## Workflow
1. Stake ETH
2. Wait (until a second user joins)
3. a) Win and get all staked funds b) Lose and lose your staked funds

This idea can be extended to larger lottery pools to amplify risk-reward profile.
